# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
The backend was successfully authenticating users and generating JWT tokens, but the Next.js server-side actions were encountering issues with the redirect functionality, causing users to see "Login failed, please try again later" instead of being redirected to the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to how Next.js Server Actions handle redirects. When using the `redirect()` function in a server action, it throws a special NEXT_REDIRECT error that should be caught by the Next.js framework. However, in our implementation, there was an issue with this redirection process, causing it to fail silently.

## Solution Implemented
We've completely restructured the authentication flow to use a client-side approach rather than relying on server-side redirects:

1. **Server Action Changes**:
   - Modified server actions (`loginPatient`, `loginDoctor`, `signupPatient`) to return response objects instead of using redirects
   - Added more robust error handling and logging
   - Fixed response parsing to properly handle the JWT tokens

2. **Client-Side Handling**:
   - Updated login/signup pages to handle the server action responses on the client side
   - Added loading states during authentication
   - Improved error message display
   - Added client-side navigation using the Next.js router

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Added loading indicators during login/signup
   - Enhanced error feedback with more detailed messages
   - Implemented proper toast notifications

## How the New Flow Works

### Login Process
1. User submits login credentials
2. Client shows a loading spinner
3. Server action makes API request to the backend
4. Server action returns a structured response object (success/error)
5. Client-side code processes this response:
   - If successful: Stores token in localStorage and navigates to dashboard
   - If failed: Shows error message and allows retry

### Registration Process
Similar flow to login, with appropriate success/error handling.

## Testing the Fix
1. Try logging in with valid credentials
2. Check for appropriate error messages with invalid credentials
3. Verify that registration works correctly
4. Ensure JWT tokens are properly stored in localStorage

## Benefits of the New Approach
1. More robust error handling
2. Better user feedback during authentication
3. Simplified debugging (clear separation of server and client responsibilities)
4. Avoids Next.js redirect issues
5. Properly handles token storage in browser

The login and registration process should now work consistently without the "login failed" errors.
